# 🌌 Solar System Explorer

A 3D interactive simulation of our solar system built with **Three.js**, featuring orbiting planets, moons, an asteroid belt, and even shooting stars. It's basically what you'd get if NASA had a graphics API and too much coffee. This is a visual simulation—not scientifically accurate, but definitely fun to explore.

## 🪐 Features

- Realistic planetary orbits and rotations
- Textured models of planets and moons
- Glowing sun with emissive shading
- Dynamic asteroid belt simulation
- Randomly generated shooting stars
- Orbit path visuals for all celestial bodies
- Camera controls for full navigation

💡 Cool Details
- All planetary motion is slowed down by a factor of ~5 for better visibility.
- Moons orbit their planets using a nested Object3D system.
- Shooting stars fade out and despawn naturally to keep the scene lively but not chaotic.
- The asteroid belt uses randomized parameters for position and motion—no two rocks are alike!
